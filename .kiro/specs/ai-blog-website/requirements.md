# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dynamic blog website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that combines AI-generated content with manual admin posts. The system automatically generates and publishes AI content every 12 hours while providing a protected admin interface for manual post creation. The React frontend displays both types of posts with clear indicators of their origin, creating an engaging blog experience that blends automated content generation with human curation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog visitor, I want to view all blog posts on the homepage, so that I can browse both AI-generated and manually created content in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the React homepage THEN the system SHALL display all blog posts in chronological order
2. WHEN displaying posts THEN the system SHALL show post title, first 150 characters of content, publication date, and post type indicator
3. WHEN a post is AI-generated THEN the system SHALL display an "AI-Generated" indicator
4. WHEN a post is manually created THEN the system SHALL display a "Manual" indicator
5. WHEN the React component loads THEN the system SHALL fetch posts dynamically from the Express.js backend API

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog visitor, I want to read individual blog posts in full, so that I can access complete content with proper formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a post preview THEN the React Router SHALL navigate to a dedicated post page
2. WHEN viewing a post page THEN the React component SHALL display the full title, complete content, publication date, and post type
3. WHEN on a post page THEN the React component SHALL provide responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
4. WHEN accessing a post URL directly THEN the React Router SHALL load the specific post content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to access a protected admin panel, so that I can create manual blog posts without unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin route THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL deny access to the admin panel
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the admin post creation interface
4. WHEN using basic authentication THEN the system SHALL protect the admin routes with username/password

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to create manual blog posts through a form interface, so that I can publish custom content alongside AI-generated posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in the React admin panel THEN the system SHALL provide a form with title and content fields
2. WHEN submitting a valid post THEN the Express.js backend SHALL save the post to MongoDB with ai_generated flag set to false
3. WHEN a post is successfully created THEN the React component SHALL provide confirmation feedback
4. WHEN form validation fails THEN the React component SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a manual post is created THEN the system SHALL immediately make it available on the public blog

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want AI posts to be generated automatically every 12 hours, so that the blog maintains fresh content without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Node.js server starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a node-cron job to run every 12 hours
2. WHEN the cron job executes THEN the Express.js server SHALL generate new AI content
3. WHEN AI content is generated THEN the system SHALL save it to MongoDB with ai_generated flag set to true
4. WHEN an AI post is created THEN the Node.js server SHALL log the creation event
5. WHEN AI generation fails THEN the Node.js server SHALL log the error and continue normal operation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a RESTful API backend, so that the React frontend can interact with blog data through standard HTTP methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /posts THEN the Express.js server SHALL return all blog posts in JSON format
2. WHEN a POST request is made to /admin/post THEN the Express.js server SHALL create a new manual blog post
3. WHEN API requests are made from React THEN the Express.js server SHALL handle CORS appropriately for frontend access
4. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the Express.js server SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN the API is accessed THEN the Express.js server SHALL validate request data and sanitize inputs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want blog posts stored in MongoDB, so that data persists reliably with proper structure and indexing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a post is created THEN the system SHALL store it with title, content, date, and ai_generated fields
2. WHEN storing posts THEN the system SHALL automatically set the creation date
3. WHEN querying posts THEN the system SHALL support efficient retrieval and sorting
4. WHEN the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN posts are retrieved THEN the system SHALL return them in consistent JSON format

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a blog visitor using mobile devices, I want the website to be responsive, so that I can read posts comfortably on any screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the React components SHALL adapt layout for screen sizes below 768px
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN the React components SHALL optimize layout for medium screen sizes
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the React components SHALL utilize full screen width effectively
4. WHEN text is displayed THEN the React components SHALL ensure readability across all device types
5. WHEN navigation elements are present THEN the React components SHALL remain accessible on touch devices
